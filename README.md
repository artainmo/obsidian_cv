# obsidian_cv
Personal project. Git repository synchronized with obsidian submodule to take up-to-date curriculum vitae note and display it as a website using Jekyll, [obsidian-html](https://obsidian-html.github.io/) and custom transformations.

## Make changes
Change the website's content via the associated obsidian note.

Make custom changes on the website in the case the transformation from markdown to HTML went wrong via 'obsidian-html/transform.sh'.

Add pictures from obsidian to the website via the 'makefile'. 

## Custom domain
I registered a custom domain at [hello.cv](https://www.hello.cv/).
